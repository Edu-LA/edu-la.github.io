                    <h2>About This Project</h2>
                    <p>This project was made in the context of a photography class with the objective of creating a themed herbarium. The them was free choice, and I chose to document something very personal to me in the form of the abandonment of Portugal's countryside.</b></p>
                    <p>The objective of this work is to demonstrate the abandonment of the interior area of Portugal through a style named "urban decay", that is, photos of Houses that have been consumed by the surrounding nature.</p>
                    <p>To make this work, I walked the paths of many villages around the place where i was born and lived all my life, including the itenerary I had to do daily to go to university. I spent weeks in search of houses that are in a high state of degradation and after taking several photographs, I selected the 6 that I thought were the best and used digital treatment to bring out the green hue of the plants as a way to reinforce the idea that nature took over these formerly inhabited places.</p>
                    <p>This project was also inspired by two very relevant photography collections. <a href="https://www.rebeccabathory.com/orphansoftime">"Orphans of time"</a> by Rebecca Bathory and <a href="http://matthiashaker.de/?portfolio=impermanence">"Impermanence"</a> by Matthias Haker.</p>
